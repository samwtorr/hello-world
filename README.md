### A short bio about myself
My name is Sam, and I'm a 23 year old living in Washington D.C. I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering but I now work in business consulting. My favorite thing about myself is that I'm deeply curious- I need to know how and why everything works. I love all mainstream forms of media: movies, books, television, music, sports, video games. I love wooden pencils. I believe in the king's indian defense and the air raid offense. I *don't* believe in favorites, or at least, I never seem to know what my favorite movies, books, tv, music, sports, or videogames are. I chew on ice and I know it's not good for your teeth but I can't stop. I'm pretentious and I can be thoughtless, but I'm trying to be better. I'm having trouble ending this, and the big green button that says "Commit changes..." makes this feel like a high stakes situation, but I think I've written enough.
You be good. I love you.
